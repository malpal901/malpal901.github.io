&lt;p&gt;After traveling for a week in France during a pandemic, with a total stranger, in a rental car, I have a lot of things I’ve learned and observed. It was a very fun and fulfilling week, but not necessarily the easiest week. I love traveling and cramming in as much as possible into every day because there truly is never a shortage of things to see and do in France, but this week also reminded me of the importance of slowing down. Since I have so many things to share, I thought it would be easier to just list them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;post-img block&quot;&gt;

  &lt;figcaption&gt;Cassis and its harbor were truly so picturesque it was a dream.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Port Grimaud was a mini and way more colorful version of Venice.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;French people really mind their own business. I was very apprehensive going into this week due to traveling not just during a pandemic, but as France’s cases rise. I was very safe and we took precautions, but I was worried les français would shame me for traveling at this time. No one cared, and I honestly appreciated it. There’s less shame and judgment here with respect to how everyone conducts themselves during COVID. It can be a good thing and a bad thing, but in this case, it worked out in my favor. A further anecdote to this point is that when we accidentally drove into a pedestrian only zone in Nice, the shopkeepers did not bother to help us get out of there, they only yelled at us for being there or laughed at us. Luckily, a nice woman enjoying a coffee with her friend guided us out.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Driving was an adventure in and of itself. I knew it was more expensive to drive than in the US, but the price of gas shocked me. Parking was never cheap in the bigger cities (though coming from New York this shouldn’t have surprised me), and the tolls were much more expensive than I’m used to. We had some adventures, including very tiny parking garages (and despite asking for the smallest car size possible, we were in a crossover-type SUV), driving in a pedestrian only zone in Nice, taking backroads to avoid aforementioned tolls that wound up and down cliff-sides and along the water, and our engine light being on for the first half of the trip.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

  &lt;figcaption&gt;The chateau of Aiguines was sadly closed but the views were still beautiful.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;French people get a bad rep for being unfriendly, especially towards Americans. However, one night in St. Tropez we were seated next to a young French couple from Nice. We mentioned we were heading to Nice later in our trip, and gave us their numbers. Once in Nice, we got lunch with the girl, drinks with the guy, and they invited us to come back to Nice and stay with them whenever (as well as come skiing with them this winter). This not only reminded me why I love traveling, but also reminded me that even though sometimes the stereotypes about a given people can be true, there are always exceptions to the rule.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;There are a lot of not-so-great things about living in France during a pandemic, but one massive positive is I am seeing France in a rare way. There aren’t the masses of tourists as usual. I get to see the country in a very authentic form. While I understand the tourism industry is a massive sector of the economy here, I feel like I get to see an unspoiled version of France - the last time there were no tourists here really was around World War II (also, the last time they had a curfew was then too…). It’s really special and when I get sad about the possibility of people not being able to visit me, I remind myself of this.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

  &lt;figcaption&gt;The south of France is seriously so colorful.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Traveling with a stranger is no easy thing. Kristin and I met on the Facebook group before coming, and I knew I wanted to travel for the first break. She was game and also down for my tendency to cram a million things into every day. Usually when I travel with my family they get tired of my penchant for planning every minute, but Kristin really crushed it (so thank you Kristin!). I also appreciated that we were both mature enough to acknowledge that 8 days together is a REALLY long time, and alone time would be necessary. Almost every day of the trip, we split up for a few hours to explore on our own. These were some great times for me to relax, take in the city through a bar, and call home. The older I get, the more I realize how important alone time is for me to recharge. While I am definitely an extrovert, the pandemic reminded me how good it is to spend time with yourself. I did this a lot abroad, but not as much in the years following. I’m glad to have these months in France to remember how important solitude is for the soul.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Finally made it to Menton 2.5 years later! It was incredible and I plan to go back.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;During quarantine, I struggled with being stuck inside for so long. One of the things I loved about this trip is that even though we rented a car, we spent so much time walking and being mobile. I felt like we covered so much ground that way. I have always found that walking/running/biking around is the best way to get to know a city, and I really appreciated France being in a position for this trip where that was possible. I always feel better when I’m walking a lot, and I feel like it’s always a good time to reflect on any number of things.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;I learned so much at the International Museum of Perfume and understand why it is so important to France.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;One of the things that was a huge growth experience was not just traveling with a stranger, but traveling with a stranger from a very different region of the country. We often say the US is a big place, but rarely do we actually witness that fact in action. I am from outside NYC, one of the biggest metropolitan areas in the world. I went to school in a place that attracted a lot of people from the same region, and then moved to Boston, which despite being smaller, is still very similar. My travel partner is from St. Louis and went to Mizzou. These are super different regions of the US, and despite us being similar in many ways, it was a bit of culture shock in the beginning because we came from very different backgrounds. We learned a lot from each other, and for that I am grateful. I was also reminded how music is always a great equalizer and common ground, because we had lots of common artists that we loved listening to on our long drives.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;post-img block&quot;&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Our final AirBnB was very remote but very lovely and peaceful.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;post-img right-inline&quot;&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;We rented a paddle boat in the Gorges du Verdon and had it almost entirely to ourself.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I didn’t really have any expectations for this trip. For starters, I was so occupied with even being able to get to France that my brain wasn’t really focused on the actual travel aspect. Second, I had a feeling a lot of these cities we explored might be very empty due to it being the off season and a pandemic. Third, I knew I was taking a huge risk traveling with a stranger and if it didn’t go well, it would put a damper on the whole trip. Fourth, I have never been to Europe in the fall. I wasn’t sure what to expect at all. I wasn’t sure if there would be foliage, things would be closed, or it would just be an altogether weird vibe. But this lack of expectations meant that everything we saw blew me out of the water. Not letting myself think about how the trip could go meant anything would be better than nothing. The cities were NOT empty and very lively. Traveling with a stranger went swimmingly. And fall in France is seriously incredible.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve been here two weeks today and it does kind of feel like time has flown. The saying “the days are long but the years are short” really only took meaning for me after college, and it is so real. Fewer tears and fewer times needing to call home or Jack to get myself out of a sadness spiral.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lot of little sayings keep me grounded in times of transition. One day at a time is a favorite, as is everything happens for a reason, but another one that my sister reminded me of when I was talking about my crippling FOMO issue is “comparison is the thief of joy.” Joy seems to be something that we talk about a lot more, thanks to Marie Kondo. But her MO is about getting rid of stuff to make space for more joy in your life (an approach I do agree with to an extent). But this idea of comparison being at the root of many of my complaints and woes really spoke to me, and is one I have been keeping in mind while off on this adventure alone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;post-img left-inline&quot;&gt;
  &lt;a href=&quot;/assets/img/posts/2020-10-16/Fall foliage in Avignon.jpeg&quot;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/posts/2020-10-16/Fall foliage in Avignon.jpeg&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Foliage here isn't the same but I love it still.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I struggle with comparing myself to others to a fault. I obsess over what my friends in other cities are doing on weekends, who they are hanging out with, how happy they seem based on the lie of social media. I compare myself to how others look, what they wear, their career or academic success. But I am at a point in my life where what I am doing isn’t really comparable to anyone else. Other than the friends I’ve made so far and the mutual connections I have partaking in TAPIF, no one I know is doing something like this, so to compare myself to everyone back home sert à rien.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;post-img right-inline&quot;&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;The streets of Avignon are all tinged with off white.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While FOMO has definitely become less of a thing for me during the pandemic, I do still feel it at times. In France I find myself comparing what I am doing to what others are doing, or thinking about my life before I left and missing it. I am trying to work instead on reframing the thought into reminding myself what a great opportunity this is, and how cool is it that I don’t have to work on Wednesdays? It’s a weird adjustment, but it’ll get easier with time. Instead of comparing myself to the other assistants and their backgrounds, I need to let myself just get to know people in time. I could spend time thinking about what my family is doing without me, but the reality is things are the same as they were before I left.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;post-img left-inline&quot;&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;The view from the house of the mutual friend of a friend I stayed at last Saturday in Éguilles.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, comparison can also be a good thing too when not used to determine self worth. For example, I am trying to be conscious about recognizing how things are different here than in the US but that doesn’t make them bad (one notable example is grocery stores and how there’s not a prepared food section which I am embarrassed to admit I got a lot of my meals from when living in Boston). Growing up, my mom always reminded us that different isn’t right or wrong, it’s just different. I keep this in mind as I observe how French classrooms are set up unlike American classrooms, and how French kids seem to be better behaved than American kids. I can appreciate these differences for being different, but I am trying to be conscious not to think of one as better than the other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All this to say that I am still adjusting, but I am finding if I focus on the here and now instead of what’s going on back home, it helps a lot. I am working on reading the news less, especially in comparing COVID situations between France and the US. This morning I erased all news alerts from my phone before even reading them, and I would call that growth. I also find myself jumping to American podcasts less and trying to explore French music (my listening skills are not yet calibrated to the level of podcasts in French… but I hope to get there). I’ve been here two weeks, but I feel miles from how I felt when I arrived here two Fridays ago and couldn’t stop questioning what I’d done.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;View of a hillside church from a walk in Cavaillon.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some more observations here that I would like to share:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;French school children are better behaved in the age groups I am working with (6-9), but I think this is due to the teachers taking a different stance with them (I.e. the teacher does not treat the kids are her equal)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It’s hard to say if food is cheaper here because I am not in a major metro area like I was in New York/Boston, but I am able to get a really freaking delicious baguette sandwich from a chain bakery for 3,50 and that is a steal in my opinion&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Compared to my experience with Parisians, the people here, if they respond to me in English, it is not to take a jab at me but simply to help me. They do it with a kind smile and often will jump back into French if I respond in French&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I know the US is getting better at eating seasonally, but here it just feels more natural. The way they cook food, consume food, shop for food. I find myself going to the local markets every few days to get fresh veggies. And since tax is already included it’s not like I’m wasting money&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I walked into a little cafe/bar in L’Isle-sur-la-Sorgue yesterday on the pretense that there would be live music played by an American (I had been to this same cafe on Tuesday afternoon for a drink and the bartender told me this). There was no live music, but instead a group of regulars drinking coffee and glasses of rose at the ripe hour of 10:30 in the morning. No one seemed to have anywhere to rush off to, they were laughing and singing along to the radio, and despite being initially confused what I, a non-regular, was doing there, they didn’t seem to let it stop them from continuing what appeared to be their morning ritual. Witnessing this brought me joy and peace, to experience something so different from the hustle and bustle of commuters in Boston rushing to their office jobs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you for reading all the way to the end - my musings on comparison and my observations as I adjust to la vie française.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Salut tout le monde! It has been a week since I’ve arrived in France and here we are. A week filled with tears, happiness, successes, failures, and everything in between.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It has not been an easy week, but I knew it wouldn’t be (I just don’t think I realized that as I spent my last month at home saying goodbye to friends, finishing my job, packing, and enjoying living in the comfort of my parents’ home). It has been filled with lots of tears and moments of questioning why I did this in general, and also why I did this in the middle of a pandemic. The hardest part for me is not knowing if my loved ones will be able to visit me while I am here, and I need to keep reminding myself to take it one day at a time. Everything is temporary, including this situation, therefore I should enjoy it as much as possible. When else in my life will I be living alone in the south of France and teaching a mere 12 hours a week (which I don’t have to start doing until November anyway….)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had planned on spending my first week in the town where I am assigned to teach, L’Isle-sur-la-Sorgue. It is a town famous for its vast Sunday market and antique fairs. It has many adorable shops, cute bistros, and little canals and pedestrian bridges over its waterways. My AirBnB is a little apartment that has everything I need to spend a couple of days, except other people. I felt very isolated the first few days because I knew no one in the town. Coming off of spending the past six months living in a condo with my entire family and seeing tons of people before I left, this was challenging. I realized I am not good at quiet. The mornings have been the hardest part of the day for me, when no one back home is awake. I listen to lots of podcasts because hearing English and the American accents calms me, and staying connected to the news makes me feel tied to home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I move to a longer term AirBnB in the bigger city of Avignon this afternoon, and I am very excited for that. There are lots of other assistants de langue in Avignon, from the US and elsewhere (so far I have met assistants from the UK, Italy, Brazil, India, and Germany - with more to come I am sure). Avignon is a beautiful town filled with old city walls, ancient architecture, and winding streets full of little cafes to have un café ou un verre de vin. I am very excited to explore its secret alleyways and discover its hole-in-the-wall restaurants. My commute to my schools is about 25 minutes on the train, which runs somewhat randomly. I visited my schools and start my observation period Monday. They also are giving me Wednesdays and Fridays off - can’t complain about that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am in a truly beautiful region of France that I am excited to explore more of (as well as the rest of the country). The people here have been much nicer than many of the Parisians I’ve encountered in my life. The food is of course delicious, and the wine is very cheap, though I’ve also been drinking a fair amount of beer. While I am very homesick still and crave bits of America, I know with time I will start listening to French podcasts, getting to know French music, making French friends, and cooking French food. I am appreciative of everything in my life that has led me here, and I am trying my best to take full advantage of it. I find myself at times feeling regretful of my first few months of college, when I was miserably homesick and instead of joining clubs or making friends I sat in my room crying or calling my parents. I am older now, and I am a stronger person. I can do anything I set my mind to, whether that is getting out of bed in the morning, making it through a day without crying, or spending 7ish months in France.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some observations from my first week:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;grapes here are not seedless. but that hasn’t stopped me from eating the seeds.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;french people are definitely trendy but it’s not because they wear these crazy fashionable things, it’s because they were simple clothes with confidence. that’s the difference.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the attitude towards coronavirus is not like it was in the US.  people wear masks, but no one social distances really. people see this as just a facet of life now, but are continuing as normal otherwise.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;french bureaucracy is no fun and rather confusing/overwhelming.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;i am no longer ashamed to be american which is ironic because now is the time to be most ashamed. when i was in geneva i did everything i could to appear not american. here i’m realizing, ok at this point i know that it’s fairly easy to pick us out of a lineup just because.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;specific to covid: surgical masks are much more popular than personal cloth masks here. but i love my cloth masks.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;french people don’t multitask. they don’t walk and talk on the phone, or walk and eat, or walk and drink coffee. they much prefer to do one thing at a time. i have gotten a lot of looks for walking around and being on the phone or texting. but i get those looks in the US sometimes too.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the produce here is fresher, but that means it goes bad more easily. and they don’t refrigerate eggs! i remember this from geneva but i kinda forgot about it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

I am moving there for about 8 or 9 months to teach English to French elementary schoolers in a small town called L’Isle-sur-la-Sorgue. It is known as the Venice of Provence with its waterwheels and rivers, and famous for its antique fairs and weekly market. To say I am excited would be an understatement, but to say that I am apprehensive is also true. I have spent the past year and a half dreaming about this day and this moment, and it looks kind of like I thought it would. It is the days, weeks, and months before that were nothing that I imagined.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have been fairly ambivalent about leaving for the last month. Honestly, my friends and family seem arguably more excited than I am. And I think the reason is a combination of two feelings. One is that since March, I had prepared myself for this program not to happen. I had come up with contingency plans, mentally told myself I would stay in my job for another year, and committed to delaying this almost-lifelong dream for another time. When I was accepted in late June (which was over two months later than planned), I didn’t let myself experience full excitement yet. There were a few other hurdles to get over. I had little bits of joy as I got closer and closer to my goal: happiness when I got in, cautious optimism when I found out it would be happening as a whole but was uncertain for Americans, relief when I found out Americans would be able to get visas, and finally, eagerness as I figured out how to get a COVID test in 72 hours. I would always correct people who asked when I was moving to France with a “hopefully, in late September.” Today is finally the day where I feel confident to say it’s happening.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other reason, which is ironically somewhat the opposite of the first, is that I think deep down, some part of me always knew this was going to happen. It was a matter of when. This was an inevitability in my life, kind of like going to college or moving out of my parents’ house (and I would like to take a moment to acknowledge the privilege that comes with all of these things). Now that this moment is here, it’s kind of like, ‘yeah, this is happening, but wasn’t it always going to?’ Once I hit the mark of knowing I could get in the country, I had not only spent so much energy silently wishing the program would happen, I also was ready. Maybe I’m also a little superstitious, and didn’t want to jinx myself. I spent a lot of time these past few months knocking on wood.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I said previously, the months leading up to my departure were not how I planned them. I did not get to say goodbye to the city I lived in and loved for the past 2ish years, and I miss Boston dearly. I did not get to say goodbye to my coworkers or friends in the ways I had planned. I did not get to spend time enjoying New England summers with Jack in the ways I had imagined. But that’s okay. I did get six and a half bonus months of time with my parents, my sister, and my dog. I got to live in a beautiful place on the water and not have to grocery shop for myself. I got to see Jack every few weeks, which made each time that much more special. And while I didn’t have one big goodbye party where I could say farewell to those close to me, I relished spending time in smaller groups of friends and reconnecting with old ones. All this to say that I really should adhere to the adage that God laughs when you try to make plans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This post really has helped me put into words my bittersweet feelings about leaving at a time in my life when I feel fairly content. But perhaps that is the best time for a change, no?&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Mallory Shaner</name></author><category term="France" /><category term="Travel" /><category term="Departure" /><category term="Moving" /><summary type="html">As probably everyone who is reading this can guess, I am leaving for France in approximately 6 hours.
