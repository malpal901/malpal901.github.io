      <p>I could honestly wax poetic about France and fashion. Though not like Emily in Paris. Amongst the ten thousand unrealistic things in that series, I would say her wardrobe is the one that irks me the most. Not only does it seem impossible to dress like that on a young marketing professional’s salary, no one dresses like that, especially in Paris. Her outfits are intentionally outlandish to evoke the whole living abroad vibe, but as someone who is American and living in France I would like to dispel a lot of those stereotypes. I also probably should stop holding on so tight to the inaccuracies in the series because it is just TV after all (and Bridgerton wasn’t realistic either but it did provide the escape we needed)!</p>

</figure>

<p> This is going to be a two part blog post because obviously fashion and France are synonymous and to give it anything less than full attention would be wrong. Also, this post is of course filled with mirror selfies of my outfits here. Because I love them infinitely more than anything I wear in America.</p>

  </a>
  <figcaption>I also feel chic-er in the most basic of outfits, just by virtue of being in France.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Important disclaimer: while I talk like a seasoned expert these are purely my experiences in a small region of France and I am by no means a connoisseur and am simply offering my observations (albeit with somewhat of a tone of authority).</p>

  </a>
  <figcaption>I didn't think overalls would be appropriate to wear to work. But then I saw a teacher doing it, so I copied her.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Here are a few things I’ve learned about fashion since moving here (although, to be fair, a couple of these things I learned in my other spells in France/abroad).</p>

<figure class="post-img block">

  </a>
  <figcaption>If you remember my abroad days, this leather jacket featured heavily in most photos. Of course it is back.</figcaption>
</figure>

<ul>
  <li>Simple is best. It’s no secret that a Parisian uniform is a black turtleneck and jeans, riffed on many different ways (cute booties, Hermès scarf, beige trench). But this holds true not just for Paris but for the rest of France. My teachers and the people I’ve encountered around Provence have some of the simplest, most classic style I’ve ever seen. Most people seem to have a couple of staples they wear on repeat (one teacher has a pair of high-healed Tim’s she wears with EVERY outfit, another has a Saint James sweater that goes with a lot, and in classically French fashion, another teacher wears the same scarf week after week). Major caveat being that I see these teachers once a week so it’s more likely than not that their outfits change every week.</li>
</ul>

  </a>
  <figcaption>Playing with textures and my favorite sweater that feels very French.</figcaption>
</figure>

<ul>
  <li>Versatility is important. I have tried to incorporate this rule into my shopping from a young age. I’m not entirely sure where I learned it but I do know there must be some version in France as well based on my observations: before you buy anything, think of three potential and varied outfits you can wear with it. Super important to make sure you’re not just buying something that will only work with one pair of pants. I find a lot of French people wearing giant scarves that they can bundle up while outside but can wear more as ponchos/wraps indoors.</li>
</ul>

<figure class="post-img block">
  <a href="/assets/img/posts/2021-01-28/Trench again.jpeg">

  </a>
  <figcaption>I forgot how much I loved this coat from last winter. Happily but also sadly it's been quite warm of late so I haven't been rocking it as much.</figcaption>
</figure>

<ul>
  <li>Accessorize. I’ve noticed while shopping it’s not totally uncommon to have the person working at the store tell you to try the dress with a belt or add a pair of heels to get the full look. I think this is a majorly important aspect of fashion here that complements both previous points. If you have a simple wardrobe, all you need to stand out amongst others is a couple of good accessories. Belts are big here, with jeans or cinching in a dress. Obviously the ever classic scarf is omnipresent and it’s important to have ones that are not only versatile color wise but season wise too. Jewelry is important too: everyone wears rings (though not everyone wears engagement/wedding rings, go figure). And shoes are just as much a part of an outfit as any other piece. I find my outfits definitely tend to be more simple here, but I always add a scarf, belt, or cool jewelry to give it a pop of color or something to keep it from being too basic. It seems like it’s written on every fashion blog ever to accessorize well, but it is definitely something that works in practice here.</li>
</ul>

  </a>
  <figcaption>Case in point re previous principle.</figcaption>
</figure>

<ul>
  <li>The importance of classics: capsule wardrobes are EVERYWHERE these days but I have to say that France does them best. For starters, it doesn’t seem to be some sort of Instagram trend here. It’s more a principle of the classics being timeless. The mentality of fewer, better is one that I’ve tried to inscribe in my brain from a sustainability purpose, but it’s definitely a practice in France. I see my teachers wearing a lot of the same outfits, but it’s classic styles that always work - a giant scarf that can be adapted to any outfit, a great pair of black boots, a simple pair of jeans, a navy and white striped sweater. I think due to its close association with fashion historically, people think French people are these avant-garde, super adventurous dressers. And don’t get me wrong, I see that on the street a fair amount here (though not nearly as ubiquitous as New York). But for the most part, I see people wearing the eternal staples. French fashion is on the whole, less complicated and simpler than fashion in America.</li>
</ul>
