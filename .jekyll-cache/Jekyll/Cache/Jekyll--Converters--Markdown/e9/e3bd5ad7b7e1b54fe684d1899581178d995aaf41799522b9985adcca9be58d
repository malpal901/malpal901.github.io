<p>Salut tout le monde! It has been a week since Iâ€™ve arrived in France and here we are. A week filled with tears, happiness, successes, failures, and everything in between.</p>

<p>It has not been an easy week, but I knew it wouldnâ€™t be (I just donâ€™t think I realized that as I spent my last month at home saying goodbye to friends, finishing my job, packing, and enjoying living in the comfort of my parentsâ€™ home). It has been filled with lots of tears and moments of questioning why I did this in general, and also why I did this in the middle of a pandemic. The hardest part for me is not knowing if my loved ones will be able to visit me while I am here, and I need to keep reminding myself to take it one day at a time. Everything is temporary, including this situation, therefore I should enjoy it as much as possible. When else in my life will I be living alone in the south of France and teaching a mere 12 hours a week (which I donâ€™t have to start doing until November anywayâ€¦.)</p>

<p>I had planned on spending my first week in the town where I am assigned to teach, Lâ€™Isle-sur-la-Sorgue. It is a town famous for its vast Sunday market and antique fairs. It has many adorable shops, cute bistros, and little canals and pedestrian bridges over its waterways. My AirBnB is a little apartment that has everything I need to spend a couple of days, except other people. I felt very isolated the first few days because I knew no one in the town. Coming off of spending the past six months living in a condo with my entire family and seeing tons of people before I left, this was challenging. I realized I am not good at quiet. The mornings have been the hardest part of the day for me, when no one back home is awake. I listen to lots of podcasts because hearing English and the American accents calms me, and staying connected to the news makes me feel tied to home.

<p>I move to a longer term AirBnB in the bigger city of Avignon this afternoon, and I am very excited for that. There are lots of other assistants de langue in Avignon, from the US and elsewhere (so far I have met assistants from the UK, Italy, Brazil, India, and Germany - with more to come I am sure). Avignon is a beautiful town filled with old city walls, ancient architecture, and winding streets full of little cafes to have un cafÃ© ou un verre de vin. I am very excited to explore its secret alleyways and discover its hole-in-the-wall restaurants. My commute to my schools is about 25 minutes on the train, which runs somewhat randomly. I visited my schools and start my observation period Monday. They also are giving me Wednesdays and Fridays off - canâ€™t complain about that.</p>

<p>I am in a truly beautiful region of France that I am excited to explore more of (as well as the rest of the country). The people here have been much nicer than many of the Parisians Iâ€™ve encountered in my life. The food is of course delicious, and the wine is very cheap, though Iâ€™ve also been drinking a fair amount of beer. While I am very homesick still and crave bits of America, I know with time I will start listening to French podcasts, getting to know French music, making French friends, and cooking French food. I am appreciative of everything in my life that has led me here, and I am trying my best to take full advantage of it. I find myself at times feeling regretful of my first few months of college, when I was miserably homesick and instead of joining clubs or making friends I sat in my room crying or calling my parents. I am older now, and I am a stronger person. I can do anything I set my mind to, whether that is getting out of bed in the morning, making it through a day without crying, or spending 7ish months in France.</p>

<p>Some observations from my first week:</p>
<ul>
  <li>grapes here are not seedless. but that hasnâ€™t stopped me from eating the seeds.</li>
  <li>french people are definitely trendy but itâ€™s not because they wear these crazy fashionable things, itâ€™s because they were simple clothes with confidence. thatâ€™s the difference.</li>
  <li>the attitude towards coronavirus is not like it was in the US.  people wear masks, but no one social distances really. people see this as just a facet of life now, but are continuing as normal otherwise.</li>
  <li>french bureaucracy is no fun and rather confusing/overwhelming.</li>
  <li>i am no longer ashamed to be american which is ironic because now is the time to be most ashamed. when i was in geneva i did everything i could to appear not american. here iâ€™m realizing, ok at this point i know that itâ€™s fairly easy to pick us out of a lineup just because.</li>
  <li>specific to covid: surgical masks are much more popular than personal cloth masks here. but i love my cloth masks.</li>
  <li>french people donâ€™t multitask. they donâ€™t walk and talk on the phone, or walk and eat, or walk and drink coffee. they much prefer to do one thing at a time. i have gotten a lot of looks for walking around and being on the phone or texting. but i get those looks in the US sometimes too.</li>
  <li>the produce here is fresher, but that means it goes bad more easily. and they donâ€™t refrigerate eggs! i remember this from geneva but i kinda forgot about it.</li>
</ul>
