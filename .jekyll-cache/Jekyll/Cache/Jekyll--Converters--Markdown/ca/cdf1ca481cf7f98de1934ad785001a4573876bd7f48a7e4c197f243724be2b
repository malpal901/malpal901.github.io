<p>This weekend I went to NÃ®mes for the day. Itâ€™s a slightly bigger city than Avignon in a different department/region (Gard/Occitaine) and was about a 30 minute train ride away. It was not my favorite city, or my least favorite city, but it was really nice to have a change of scenery, especially as we potentially head into a third lockdown.</p>

<p>Less wordy blog post this week because Iâ€™d prefer to share pictures from a new place, which is one of the main purposes I intended this blog to have! I think one of the things this pandemic has taught a lot of us is how to explore and more importantly appreciate the places close to us.</p>

<p>NÃ®mes is slightly bigger than Avignon and contains a lot of Roman ruins. Thereâ€™s a giant arena, the Maison CarrÃ© which looks kind of like a Parthenon-type structure, and a giant park which has a Roman temple.</p>

<p>I think one of the coolest things about NÃ®mes, and a lot of this region of France, is that the ruins are sort of interspersed among the more modern aspects of the city. Ruins are always cool, but itâ€™s way cooler to be wandering around them amidst the more modern aspects of the city.</p>

<p>This city definitely didnâ€™t wow me, but it was nice to leave my familiar walls of Avignon and see something new. We had a great picnic for lunch complete with lots of cheese and bread, and I got a delicious sundae. Hopefully more opportunities to explore nearby cities in the future, notwithstanding a potential third confinement!</p>
