I"ç<p>Two posts in a week because I slacked on my one post a week plan so I am making up for lost time! I‚Äôll be posting twice a week if I stick to my schedule for the next month-ish. Also, since I am cranking out these posts and admittedly not taking as many photos since I am not traveling/venturing out as much, they are more text-heavy.</p>

<p>Being home was really lovely. I feel beyond grateful that I had the opportunity to go home for the two week vacation I had at Christmas. Originally, I hadn‚Äôt planned to return stateside for that time because I was hoping my family and Jack would be able to visit me in France and we would get to do some traveling. How shortsighted that feels now.</p>

<p>As I readjust to being back in France, living alone in a foreign country amidst a global pandemic, I‚Äôm reflecting on the two weeks I had back in New York. Leading up to it, I was immensely excited. It was all I could talk about. My teachers would ask me what I had planned and I honestly answered them - nothing really. Just seeing my loved ones.</p>

<p>On my last night in France, amidst some logistical nightmares of having to move my stuff out of my AirBnB, I did feel a bit sad to be leaving for what felt like quite a while. Especially knowing that many of my friends in Avignon would be spending Christmas in France away from family and their loved ones, I felt almost guilty leaving. That was quickly replaced by straight up excitement once I got off the plane and saw Jack and Apollo in my very old silver Rav4.</p>

<p>The first week I was home was kind of a weird adjustment. I missed France a lot, but I think I also missed the autonomy I had in France. In Avignon, I live alone and don‚Äôt really have to answer to anyone. I can watch TV as loud as I like. I can watch what I want, when I want. I can do my dishes after I eat or the next morning. It‚Äôs a lot like the autonomy I had as a college student, since I have similar amounts of free time (just no copious amounts of reading and essays to do). It was weird having people to talk to at all hours of the day. I had gotten used to waking up and not having to interact with humans for a couple of hours. At home, Morgan usually woke me up and we launched right into the day.</p>

<p>After being at home for a week, though, I was readjusted. I loved having my mom cook for me, and not being the only one who needed to do all the dishes. It was nice to be able to cook in an American kitchen (read: BIG). It was nice sleeping in a well-insulated room and having fast WiFi all the time. I do take these things for granted and going home for a brief time was a good way to remember to appreciate them when I return to America permanently (and yes, I will return permanently).</p>

<p>I remember when I came home from abroad, I was really worried about having some sort of massive culture shock once I was stateside. That never really happened. In hindsight, that makes a lot of sense - America is where I grew up, so it‚Äôs really easy to readjust to it. I wasn‚Äôt expecting any massive culture shock when I came home this time either, honestly. But part of me was curious if anything would feel different. The only really disorienting thing was going to an American grocery store and remembering the size and the amount of choices there are. It was overwhelming and I felt lost, honestly.</p>

<p>On the other hand, as grateful as I was to be home for the holidays, there was a distinct feeling in the air that made it different from other years. The looming specter of COVID and the tumultuous year that 2020 has been felt incredibly strong while I was home. While Christmas was special in its own way, it was a very different Christmas. New Year‚Äôs Eve was a blast, but the two person dance party Morgan and I had was a far cry from the wig party I went to in Boston a couple of years ago. As hard and weird as this holiday season was, though, I just felt incredibly lucky to be home with those closest to me.</p>

<p>I have a lot I could write about being home - everything I did, the people I saw, the Christmas movies I watched, what I cooked, the American food I ate (FRIED CHICKEN!!!). But the most important thing to write about was how lucky I felt to have been able to afford to go home, to travel safely and arrive home (and back in France no less) sans COVID, and to have the health of my loved ones.</p>

<p>As I sit in my slightly cold (thanks Provence and your tendency to build things with stone) new AirBnB that still feels decidedly new, in silence, trying to adjust to living alone and in France once again, I try to remember two things: home is a feeling, not necessarily a place; and that the people that make me feel at home are not going anywhere.</p>
