I"â<p>I could honestly wax poetic about France and fashion. Though not like Emily in Paris. Amongst the ten thousand unrealistic things in that series, I would say her wardrobe is the one that irks me the most. Not only does it seem impossible to dress like that on a young marketing professionalâ€™s salary, no one dresses like that, especially in Paris. Her outfits are intentionally outlandish to evoke the whole living abroad vibe, but as someone who is American and living in France I would like to dispel a lot of those stereotypes. I also probably should stop holding on so tight to the inaccuracies in the series because it is just TV after all (and Bridgerton wasnâ€™t realistic either but it did provide the escape we needed)!</p>
