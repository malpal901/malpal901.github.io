I"3<p>I’ve been here two weeks today and it does kind of feel like time has flown. The saying “the days are long but the years are short” really only took meaning for me after college, and it is so real. Fewer tears and fewer times needing to call home or Jack to get myself out of a sadness spiral.</p>
