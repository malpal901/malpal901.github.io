<p>Almost caught up on the backlog of blog posts when I was home for Christmas. On a Monday note, Mondays are always kind of tough, France or the US, pandemic or not. But this Monday was especially hard because I woke up to looking at all the Super Bowl snacks on Instagram stories and it didn’t only make me hungry but it made me kind of homesick for things like sliders, chicken wings (which, to be fair, I had last weekend), and buffalo chicken dip.</p>

<p>Today’s post is photo heavy because it was a busy and fun-filled weekend/week and reminded me that it is possible to have fun despite a 6 PM curfew, as long as you plan properly.</p>

  <figcaption>It's supposed to be a planned area with long esplanades, green spaces, and fountains. It felt kind of utopian and futuristic.</figcaption>

<p>Friday I went to Montpellier with a couple of assistants for the day. It was nice to be in a bit bigger of a city than Avignon that also felt way more lively than Nîmes. I also got some amazing poke that hit the spot.</p>

  <figcaption>We had to wait until 12 PM for this garden to open, but it was worth it.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Montpellier is one of the faster-growing cities in France and has a massive (25%) student population. It had lots of open spaces close to the centre ville and is within tram/biking distance to the beach (which I did not see).</p>

<p>Since museums are closed the main activity is to just walk around outside, but this botanical garden in the centre ville was open.</p>

  <figcaption>I thought this was really cool - a mural of what this building might have once looked like.</figcaption>

<p>Of course, after a cloudy morning the sun came out in Montpellier. I definitely want to go back, hopefully when restaurants open!</p>

<p>Saturday morning, Margaret and I were craving American breakfast sandwiches so I used a recipe I had made part of before, added bacon, used French ingredients, and bam. Amazing brunch, complete with mimosas with fresh squeezed OJ. We then had a very small housewarming gathering with some of the other assistants, which was a blast. Started early due to curfew, and then ended watching a movie, ordering in McDonalds, and playing guitar. Honestly, not bad for curfew and COVID.</p>

  <figcaption>We looked pretty American leaving the supermarket with tons of chips. But also slightly French because we also bought cheeses and meats.</figcaption>
