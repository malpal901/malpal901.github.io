<p>Last week as I was spending a glorious day in the countryside of Provence with a new friend and my French family (who my family has known for 50 years), I felt immensely at peace and content. The specter of reconfinement was looming but I was ignoring it. I combined a little list of the things that were making me happy in that moment and in the last few days to remember this special time and to remind myself of the good stuff to look forward to when reconfinement is over. I called this list â€˜petits instances de bonheur.â€™</p>

  <figcaption>I love the contrast between the plain red walls and the vividly painted blue door.</figcaption>

<p>I had one of these lists when I was younger and in high school and thought it was cute and Pinterest-y. But honestly, I did end up loving adding things to it and looking back on it to see old things that used to make me happy (some that still did, some that didnâ€™t anymore). I love lists. I always have. Iâ€™m glad that I brought this practice back into my life because it is a soothing act for me to make a list, and itâ€™s also a good reminder to look back on moments of happiness.</p>

<p>I honestly didnâ€™t think Iâ€™d be adding to this list during reconfinement because I didnâ€™t think Iâ€™d be very happy. When the news hit, I was absolutely distraught. I fought back tears all day, and by the end of the day broke down to my mom telling her I wanted to come home. Itâ€™s been a week since the announcement, and about six days in actual lockdown. Iâ€™m doing okay, all things considered. Iâ€™m keeping a daily journal that I plan to publish at the end. But for now I wanted to share my little moments of happiness with everyone else as we are all in uncertain times.</p>

<p>I cannot post a blog post at this time without acknowledging the impact of the election in the United States. There has been a major focus on self-care during this election and I want to emphasize that as well. Making this list, writing this post and this blog, and a lot of the things on this list are not just moments of happiness, but moments of self-care as well. As I grow more and more dismayed about the state of our country and the fact that nearly 70 million people decided yet again that racism, homophobia, sexism, and being a downright criminal are not dealbreakers, I try to remember the little things to make me happy and to keep me sane. I invite you to do the same.</p>
