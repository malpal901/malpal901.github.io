  <figcaption>Arguably the most important part of establishing a routine is having a place to call home and be cozy. Behold - my room!</figcaption>
</figure>

  <figcaption>Cooking delicious meals with Margaret is another important part of routine, both specifically to me but also I think to life in France in general.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>It feels nice to say that after almost five months here, I can confidently say I have a routine. To be fair, moving three times would cause a disrupt in that routine easily.</p>

  <figcaption>We went to a small gathering last weekend and they had two seafood platters, which felt kind of random. Accepting these random instances is just part of my routine.</figcaption>

    <img src="/assets/img/posts/2021-02-20/Happy pup.jpeg" />
  </a>
  <figcaption>This pup only had two legs but he looked happier than ever. Since it's less normal to pet dogs here, I just take creepy pictures from afar.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>But since I feel less like writing and more like showing photos, I figured Iâ€™d make this a two-part post with the first part being photos of my day to day.</p>

  </a>
  <figcaption>I guess since donuts aren't a huge thing here, cops have to eat baguettes? I really enjoyed the contradiction between the pastries and his gun. But again, part of my routine is getting bread very frequently (and trying new bakeries when I can).</figcaption>
</figure>

    <img src="/assets/img/posts/2021-02-20/L'isle is my love.jpeg" />
  </a>
  <figcaption>I love L'Isle-sur-la-Sorgue and seeing the beauty in it is also part of my daily routine.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>I am also on vacation for the next two weeks! Itâ€™s crazy because when it comes down to it, Iâ€™m in France for seven months but only teaching for 21 of those.</p>

<figure class="post-img block">
  <a href="/assets/img/posts/2021-02-20/Le parc.jpeg">
    <img src="/assets/img/posts/2021-02-20/Le parc.jpeg" />
  </a>
  <figcaption>I was going for a run on a gorgeous day and even though I had walked through this park before, I never noticed the stained glass window and church remnants. France is so gorgeous.</figcaption>
</figure>

  </a>
  <figcaption>Our apartment is in the building with the seafoam windows, and the building leans quite a bit. According to our landlord, this is because it's built on the original city walls.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>While Iâ€™m bummed to not be going home for this break, I am grateful that I get to go to Paris for a few days! I love Avignon but the thought of going to a big city (and not just any big city) is super exciting.</p>

  </a>
  <figcaption>Roommates (or colocs, in French slang) with matching scrunchies! That we bought from a female owned small business.</figcaption>
</figure>

  <figcaption>Most days I go into this grocery store in L'Isle while I wait for the bus. This guy is usually outside with his dog playing the violin. The other day he was playing a hauntingly beautiful rendition of Hallelujah while it was raining and it was insane.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Plus, itâ€™s pretty wild that Iâ€™ve been in France for five months and this is the first time Iâ€™ll be going to Paris, which is the reason I fell in love with France in the first place.</p>

  <a href="/assets/img/posts/2021-02-20/Seals.jpeg">
    <img src="/assets/img/posts/2021-02-20/Seals.jpeg" />
  </a>
  <figcaption>In middle school, we learned the word for seal in French was phoque, which sounds a lot like a curse word that us 12-year-olds were too scared to say. So we thought we were pretty cool saying it in French.</figcaption>
</figure>

    <img src="/assets/img/posts/2021-02-20/Sewing machines.jpeg" />
  </a>
  <figcaption>I went to get my haircut and all of the tables were made out of old sewing machines. I guess part of my routine is finding the beauty in normally ordinary things.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Anyway, here are some pictures from my day-to-day. I definitely think I have more of a tendency to take photos here because I try and notice everything. Hopefully itâ€™s a habit Iâ€™ll continue with.</p>

  <figcaption>Also routine - the kids I teach being adorable. They gave each other compliments in English for Valentine's day. And included me in the fun!</figcaption>

  <figcaption>One of the parks near our apartment that I often eat lunch in on my days off. I like buying a meal from somewhere new (to support the restaurants!) and sitting in the park. Me and all the high schoolers. No, but it's actually quite nice.</figcaption>
