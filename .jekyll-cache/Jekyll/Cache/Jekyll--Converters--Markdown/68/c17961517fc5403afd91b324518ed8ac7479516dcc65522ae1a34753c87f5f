I"©<p>As promised, a part II to last weekâ€™s fashion post. Slightly delayed but that is because I was moving apartments !!! Yes, for this keeping track at home this is my third move since getting to France. No, it does not get any easier but yes this apartment seems like itâ€™s a keeper. I also have a roommate now and we do fun things together like eat baguettes while doing barre, cooking bomb meals made with fresh French ingredients, and puzzle while watching French TV. But since the delay in posts I also bought a FEW more soldes purchases, therefore ensuring I have a few more mirror pics to add to this weekâ€™s list (and a new mirror from which I am taking said pics).</p>
