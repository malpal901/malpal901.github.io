I don't have a lot to write about since it has only been four days since my last post. But since my phone is broken I haven't been able to post pictures on Instagram, so I thought instead I could post pictures that my friends have taken over the past few days before I go home for Christmas.

Even though it hasn't been easy, having a group of friends here (largely Anglophones) in Avignon has made an extraordinarily difficult transition and time that much easier. They push me out of my comfort zone, they encourage me to see or explore different perspectives, and they are always game to have fun.

This week, I spent time having a relaxing wine night while listening to the new Taylor Swift, made mimosas and brunch for a couple of friends, attended a Christmas party with lots of varieties of alcohol and delicious fries, and showed some pals around the market in L'Isle-sur-la-Sorgue.

I also spent time with some French people as well, and was reminded for the nth time the importance of food and how much time is spent related to it. We went for a walk in the woods, but then came home and chatted while our hostess made mushroom risotto. Her partner came home with desserts for her birthday, and we had wine and bread and good conversation. It was really special.

It was a great last week before I get to go home for Christmas! This week I'm especially excited to talk about Christmas with my kids, though I know they are going to be way too jazzed about Christmas and break to really focus on anything. But we will try.

The weather this week kind of sucked and was cold and I learned that French people do not blast the heat like Americans do. While this is definitely better from an environmental standpoint, it is hard to get used to and means that when you get inside you still have a permanent chill in your bones that lingers until you go back outside, and then gets even colder. Most of my schools barely heat the teacher's lounge, and often won't heat the hallways between classes. Even if I'm inside, it's a freezing walk from class to class.

  <figcaption>Excited for cooking in winter in France - all the cozy, soup, cheesy, warm vibes await.</figcaption>

I do think it's better from a global perspective, but man is it hard to get used to. I mentioned it to a teacher too, and she said it's also because French people are frugal and do not like spending money on electricity. I get it - heating bills in Boston were no joke.

Not much to report otherwise, as I've definitely settled into a routine here. But I am sure I will have more to write about in the coming weeks with Christmas!
