This weekend I went to Nîmes for the day. It’s a slightly bigger city than Avignon in a different department/region (Gard/Occitaine) and was about a 30 minute train ride away. It was not my favorite city, or my least favorite city, but it was really nice to have a change of scenery, especially as we potentially head into a third lockdown.

Less wordy blog post this week because I’d prefer to share pictures from a new place, which is one of the main purposes I intended this blog to have! I think one of the things this pandemic has taught a lot of us is how to explore and more importantly appreciate the places close to us.

Nîmes is slightly bigger than Avignon and contains a lot of Roman ruins. There’s a giant arena, the Maison Carré which looks kind of like a Parthenon-type structure, and a giant park which has a Roman temple.

I think one of the coolest things about Nîmes, and a lot of this region of France, is that the ruins are sort of interspersed among the more modern aspects of the city. Ruins are always cool, but it’s way cooler to be wandering around them amidst the more modern aspects of the city.

This city definitely didn't wow me, but it was nice to leave my familiar walls of Avignon and see something new. We had a great picnic for lunch complete with lots of cheese and bread, and I got a delicious sundae. Hopefully more opportunities to explore nearby cities in the future, notwithstanding a potential third confinement!
