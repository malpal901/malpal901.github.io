Two posts in a week because I slacked on my one post a week plan so I am making up for lost time! I'll be posting twice a week if I stick to my schedule for the next month-ish. Also, since I am cranking out these posts and admittedly not taking as many photos since I am not traveling/venturing out as much, they are more text-heavy.

Being home was really lovely. I feel beyond grateful that I had the opportunity to go home for the two week vacation I had at Christmas. Originally, I hadn’t planned to return stateside for that time because I was hoping my family and Jack would be able to visit me in France and we would get to do some traveling. How shortsighted that feels now.

As I readjust to being back in France, living alone in a foreign country amidst a global pandemic, I’m reflecting on the two weeks I had back in New York. Leading up to it, I was immensely excited. It was all I could talk about. My teachers would ask me what I had planned and I honestly answered them - nothing really. Just seeing my loved ones.

On my last night in France, amidst some logistical nightmares of having to move my stuff out of my AirBnB, I did feel a bit sad to be leaving for what felt like quite a while. Especially knowing that many of my friends in Avignon would be spending Christmas in France away from family and their loved ones, I felt almost guilty leaving. That was quickly replaced by straight up excitement once I got off the plane and saw Jack and Apollo in my very old silver Rav4.

The first week I was home was kind of a weird adjustment. I missed France a lot, but I think I also missed the autonomy I had in France. In Avignon, I live alone and don’t really have to answer to anyone. I can watch TV as loud as I like. I can watch what I want, when I want. I can do my dishes after I eat or the next morning. It’s a lot like the autonomy I had as a college student, since I have similar amounts of free time (just no copious amounts of reading and essays to do). It was weird having people to talk to at all hours of the day. I had gotten used to waking up and not having to interact with humans for a couple of hours. At home, Morgan usually woke me up and we launched right into the day.

After being at home for a week, though, I was readjusted. I loved having my mom cook for me, and not being the only one who needed to do all the dishes. It was nice to be able to cook in an American kitchen (read: BIG). It was nice sleeping in a well-insulated room and having fast WiFi all the time. I do take these things for granted and going home for a brief time was a good way to remember
